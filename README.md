# Jira-Logger
Using the browsers to track your work is just horrible, you have to switch tabs, you have to remember how much time you’ve spent, then you have to switch back to another tab. Unless you have horse memory and remember what you’ve worked on, this tool might come in handy.
Jira-Logger is a Mac app that stays in the menu bar and you can access it any time and take notes as you finish tasks. Time tracking is done automatically.

# Features:
- track automatically the time you’ve spent on issues
- track lunch break
- track scrum meetings
- send the report of the last day to iPhone, for the scrum meeting
