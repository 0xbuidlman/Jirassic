Using the browsers to track your work is just horrible, you have to switch tabs, you have to remember how much time you’ve spent on issues... Unless you have horse memory and remember what you’ve worked the whole day, this tool is gold.
Jira-Logger is a Mac app that stays in the status bar and you can access it any time and take notes as you finish tasks. Time tracking is done automatically.

# Features:
- track automatically the time you’ve spent on issues
- track lunch break
- track scrum meetings
- view finished tasks on iPhone in the scrum meetings
